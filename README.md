3dmmInternals
=============

Reverse engineering 3D Movie Maker. So far this contains:

* functions.json, a listing of all functions in 3dmovie.exe, generated from several sources
* globals.json, a listing of manually determined globals
* classes.txt, a plain text file of some class info. 


TODO
=============
* Generate globals.json data from automatic globals-finding script as well
* clean up classes.txt research and make it into a structured .json file
* build an HTML/JS interface to functions.json/globals.json
